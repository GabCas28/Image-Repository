*Unsuitable uses means pornography, violence, spam or anything that violates the integrity of the system or their users.

## Project Planning :crystal_ball:

* During the whole project the achitecture chosed will be taken in mind.

* The first thing to do is to allow the photographer to upload pictures.

* After that, every user should be able to retrieve this picture.

* The following step is allowing the photographer to delete the picture or modify it.

* The admin of the system should be able to delete the picture as well. 

* Once the picture system is up and running, creating a new service for comments will be due. This means allowing the commenters to add commetns to the pictures.

* When the comments can be added, the next step should be allowing every user to read the comments.

* Once that is done, the comments should be modifieable or deleted by the user who wrote it, or deleted by the administrator of the system.

* The next step will be implementing the rating system. So first, ratings should be allowed for each picture.

* Once the rating is up, every user should be able to see them.

* Once ratings is public, the user that made it can cahnge it or delete it, and the admin can delete them as well.

* If there is enough time, new features might be added once the basic structure is done, such as: password-secured pictures, thumbnail generation, blur image pre-load, etc..

## Architecture :european_castle:

Since uploading and sometimes serving pictures may take a long time, an **event driven architecture** is chosen for the project.
This way, we avoid freezing server threads, unloading its charge. We also achieve a faster response and a smoother user experience.
