# Motivation

Usually photographers make pictures and want to share them with a remote audience. They may want to receive feedback about them as well.  

In fact, this is a common problem since any type of image a user can upload into any app, usually needs to be stored and retrieved many times. Therefore, a lot of applications and services make use of image management and similar resources. This is the reason to develop this small yet potentially useful project.

Without entering in authorization issues, this project intention is to create a scalable module that can be introduced into other projects, managing the pictures and allowing to add comments and reviews from other users.
