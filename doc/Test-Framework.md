# Test Framework

Mocha or Jest are my preferred choices, and they both support typescript. After trying a few testing with Mocha, I found the errors messages are a bit verbose.

Looking at the Jest output, I see it is more descriptive. And after some research, especially [[2]](#references) and [[3]](#references), I saw its benefits. It provides parallel testing, which increases testing speed. Besides, Jest's output looks way more compact yet informative.

Still, I ran some passing tests with Jest and Mocha. Then, I decided to choose Mocha for the project because it proved to be faster.

## Test Framework comparison

The output of the Jest tests shows that it took 14s to finish.
