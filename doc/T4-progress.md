# Project progress on Task 4, Continuous Integration

During the Continuous Integration setup, I made some progress in the project.

The following issue contains some the changes relative to the continuos integration (CI):

- [Configure Travis CI](https://github.com/GabCas28/Image-Repository/issues/56)

However, additional commits also fixed errors and documents and tested the GitHub Actions.

Finally, this issue shows the refactor in the code to adapt to the microservice structure:

- [Prepare microservices structure](https://github.com/GabCas28/Image-Repository/issues/59)
