# Project Planning

The project planning is divided in four milestones as phases of development, they are not linear since some of them are built in parallel.

If there is enough time, new features might be added once the basic structure is done, such as: password-secured pictures, thumbnail generation, blur image pre-load, etc..

## Phase 1. [Picture management features](https://github.com/GabCas28/Image-Repository/milestone/4)

This phase covers the features that are related to the pictures and their management. This is the most important phase of the project as it deals with the main entity which is the Picture class.

Most of the issues in this phase will be the first to be developed. These issues are the initial User Stories of this phase, and they are ordered by priority.

[[US1]](https://github.com/GabCas28/Image-Repository/issues/17) As a **photographer** I need to to **upload pictures along with their title and description** so **other users can see and comment them**.
This is the main User story, that allows the uploading of pictures.

[[US2]](https://github.com/GabCas28/Image-Repository/issues/18) As a **user** I need to **view pictures** in order to **inspire myself**.

[[US3]](https://github.com/GabCas28/Image-Repository/issues/19) As a **photographer** I want to **delete my pictures** that I **no longer want to share**.

[[US4]](https://github.com/GabCas28/Image-Repository/issues/20) As a **photographer** I need to **update my pictures** so I can change **their description, title, or even the picture itself**.
  
[[US15]](https://github.com/GabCas28/Image-Repository/issues/30) As an **administrator** I need to **delete pictures** to **prevent unsuitable uses**

## Phase 2. [Comment System](https://github.com/GabCas28/Image-Repository/milestone/5)

The second phase of the project is developing the comment system for the commenters and users that interact with them.

The user stories covered in this phase are the following:

[[US10]](https://github.com/GabCas28/Image-Repository/issues/25) As a **commenter** I need to **comment pictures** in order to **share constructive ideas**.

[[US11]](https://github.com/GabCas28/Image-Repository/issues/26) As a **user** I need to **view picture comments** in order to **see useful feedback**.

[[US12]](https://github.com/GabCas28/Image-Repository/issues/27) As a **user** I need to **vote comments** in order to **give feedback**.
  
[[US18]](https://github.com/GabCas28/Image-Repository/issues/33) As a **user** I need to **modify my vote to a comment** in order to **give feedback**.

[[US13]](https://github.com/GabCas28/Image-Repository/issues/28) As a **commenter** I need to **modify my comments** so I can **fix mistakes or add new ideas**.

[[US14]](https://github.com/GabCas28/Image-Repository/issues/29) As a **commenter** I need to **delete my comments** that **are no longer adequate**.
  
[[US16]](https://github.com/GabCas28/Image-Repository/issues/31) As an **administrator** I need to **delete comments** to **prevent unsuitable uses**.

## Phase 3. [Rating System](https://github.com/GabCas28/Image-Repository/milestone/6)

The third phase of the project, consists of developing the rating system, and will be build along with the second phase, since they have a similar topology.

Again, the issues covered in this phase are ordered by importance:

[[US5]](https://github.com/GabCas28/Image-Repository/issues/21) As a **rater** I need to **qualify pictures** in order to **support their authors**.

[[US6]](https://github.com/GabCas28/Image-Repository/issues22) As a **user** I need to **view ratings of pictures** in order to **understand what people like**.

[[US7]](https://github.com/GabCas28/Image-Repository/issues/23) As a **rater** I need to **modify my ratings** in order to **change my mind**.

[[US8]](https://github.com/GabCas28/Image-Repository/issues/24) As a **rater** I need to **delete my ratings** that **are no longer adequate**.
  
[[US17]](https://github.com/GabCas28/Image-Repository/issues/32) As an **administrator** I need to **delete ratings** to **prevent unsuitable uses**
